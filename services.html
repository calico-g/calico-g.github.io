											<p class="fh5co-serif">&ldquo;The highlight of my husband’s 60th birthday party was an African drumming and dancing extravaganza!  One World Dance & Drum arrived early to set the stage - sound system, instrument placement, and a space for dancing.  They returned at our designated time and, within minutes, the party-goers were on their feet!  It’s impossible to hear these joyous sounds without moving!  Sarah Lee provided a brief introduction to the music and culture, followed by a lesson to bring us on board.  As a trained dance instructor, we all found her simple explanations easy to follow.  Her infectious smile and exuberant energy make everyone feel like a success.  Like she says, as long as you’re smiling, you’re doing the moves right!  They were a joy to work with in every respect.  They are timely, professional, flexible, and full of love.  They invited my husband - the Birthday Boy - up front for some fun special moments, and even let our whole family play with their spectacular instruments a bit.  They truly made the party!&rdquo;</p>

Sarah Lee’s ability to break down complex movement so that it is easily accessible makes it a stunning execution of Guinean dance.&rdquo;</p>
